 App Development for Continuum 

This is my github repo for my Independent Study during the summer of 2016. I will be researching, studying, and implimenting new APIs and controls in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update SDK for Desktops, Laptops, and Mobile devices. 

This will be a continuum app that will act as a multi-slide Paint app similar to a whiteboard or blackboard mixed with Powerpoint when in desktop mode, and will be a slide viewer in mobile mode.
